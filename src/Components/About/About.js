                        <p>
                            The villa is in hamlet Margatina which is located at the end of
                            Belish, a small village near Troyan, Bulgaria. It has probably one of
                            the most amazing views in the area and i am very proud to be the
                            owner. This is the reason why i created this website. The villa is not
                            for rent. I just want to show the opportunities we have and how our normal day goes by when we are
                            there. And maybe in the future we may decide to allow others to rent it so they can experience what we experience every day there. Spoiler alert ... It is beyond AMAZING! There is not a single person who didn't lost words when he/she saw the view in front of the villa or who was not entertained.
